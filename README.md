My config for OpenHAB 1.7 (snapshot)

All of it works, but it's still very much work in progress.

TODO:
- Calculate aggregates for network traffic
- Get SNMP data from accesspoints
- Create several different sitemaps, per user, and a dashboard
- Add InfluxDB and Grafana for graphs
- When i'm actually producing energy, create aggregates and graphs for it
- Add a lot more sensors and rules :)
